# Menarche_Tracker
The tutorial app from mdn's cycle tracker app 
For context: I was curious to learn about PWAs (progressive web apps)
While on that journey, I stumbled upon the rich  documentation provided by mdn
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps (you should check it out if you are interested)

This project is an implementation of one tutorial named cycle tracker
